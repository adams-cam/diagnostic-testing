Data sets
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The small data set was transcribed from:

Bendavid et al. 2020.  COVID-19 antibody seroprevalence in Santa Clara
Count, Californa.  Version 2, April 27, 2020.
URL: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v2.full.pdf

It is used for generating all of the plots and discussion for the
paper.

The data can be found in R/santa_clara.R and R/prior_sensitivity.R


Source code
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The programs used to produce the analyses and graphics in the paper
are included in full.  These take the form of R programs for fitting
and graphics generation and Stan programs for coding the models
themselves.  

R scripts
---------------------------
To fit the models in the paper and generate the graphics, use

> source('R/santa_clara.R')

To fit the sensitivity analysis and generate the grapics, use

> source('R/prior_sensitivity.R')

* R/santa_clara.R:  code for fitting the models described in the paper
and generating graphics.

* R/prior_sensitivity.R:  code for the prior sensitivity analysis and
graphics generation.

Stan programs
---------------------------
* stan/prior_sensitivity.stan:  Stan program for generating prior sensitivities

* stan/santa-clara.stan:  simple pooled model

* stan/santa-clara-hierarchical.stan:  hierarchical model

* stan/santa-clara-hierarchical-mrp.stan:  hierarchical model with MRP
