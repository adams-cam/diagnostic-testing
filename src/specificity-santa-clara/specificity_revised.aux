(a) For the model with weak priors for $\sigma _{\gamma }$ and $\sigma _{\delta }$, the posterior inference for the prevalence, $\pi $, is highly uncertain. This is driven by the wide uncertainty for the sensitivity, which is driven by the large uncertainty in the hyperparameters for the sensitivity distribution. (b) Stronger priors on $\sigma _{\gamma }$ and $\sigma _{\delta }$ have the effect of regularizing the specificity and sensitivity parameters, leading to narrower intervals for $\pi $, the parameter of interest in this study. The hyperparameters $\mu $ and $\sigma $ are on the log odds scale and thus are difficult to interpret without transformation.}}{4}}

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces \em  Each panel shows a plot of the posterior median and central 90\% posterior interval of the prevalence, $\pi $, as a function of $\tau _{\gamma }$ and $\tau _{\delta }$, the prior scales for the specificity and sensitivity hyperparameters, $\sigma _{\gamma }$ and $\sigma _{\delta }$. The posterior median of prevalence is not sensitive to $\tau _{\gamma }$ and $\tau _{\delta }$, but the endpoints of the 90\% interval show some sensitivity. It is possible to use a weak hyperprior on the scale of the specificity distribution, $\sigma _{\gamma }$: this makes sense given that there are 13 prior specificity studies in the data. For the scale of the sensitivity distribution, $\sigma _{\delta }$, it is necessary to use a prior scale of 0.5 or less to effectively rule out the possibility of extremely high prevalence corresponding to an unrealistic sensitivity parameter $\gamma $. The noise in the rightmost graph represents Monte Carlo error that is a consequence of the weakly specified model.}}{6}}
